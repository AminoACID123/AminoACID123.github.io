### Chizpurfle: A Gray-Box Android Fuzzer for Vendor Service Customizations (ISSRE 2017)

**Abstract:** Android has become the most popular mobile OS, as it enables device manufacturers to introduce customizations to compete with value-added services. However, customizations make the OS less dependable and secure, since they can introduce software flaws. Such flaws can be found by using fuzzing, a popular testing technique among security researchers.This paper presents Chizpurfle, a novel "gray-box" fuzzing tool for vendor-specific Android services. Testing these services is challenging for existing tools, since vendors do not provide source code and the services cannot be run on a device emulator. Chizpurfle has been designed to run on an unmodified Android OS on an actual device. The tool automatically discovers, fuzzes, and profiles proprietary services. This work evaluates the applicability and performance of Chizpurfle on the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, and discusses software bugs found in privileged vendor services
