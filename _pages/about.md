Anzi Xu is currently a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn), China, under the supervision of Prof. Linzhang Wang.   
After receiving my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Nanjing University in 2020, I joined the Software Engineering Group (SEG) and went on to pursue a doctor's degree. 


Research Interest  
======  
My research interest is in the area of Software Engineering and Cyber Security. I aim to address Cyber Security problems by developing Software Engineering methods. More specifically, I focus on using program analysis, testing and verification techniques to enhance the safety, security and reliability of critical software systems such as IOT Frimware, Autonomous Driving Systems and OS kernels.
